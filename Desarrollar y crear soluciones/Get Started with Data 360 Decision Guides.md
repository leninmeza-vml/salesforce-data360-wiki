[Data 360 Provisioning](./Data%20360%20Decision%20Guides/Data%20360%20Provisioning.md)

*   **Home Org Selection** : Decide whether to provision Data 360 in an existing production org or create a dedicated org, considering governance, compliance, and time-to-value.
*   **Multi-Org Strategy** : Choose between multiple independent Data 360 instances or using Data Cloud One to unify multiple Salesforce orgs, balancing autonomy, compliance, and cost.
*   **Data Cloud One Architecture** : Enable multiple Companion Orgs to share a single Data 360 instance with centralized governance, metadata sharing, and feature parity across orgs.
*   **Data Sharing Between Data 360 Orgs** : Use zero-copy data sharing between independent instances for regional compliance, business unit collaboration, or federated executive dashboards.
*   **Provisioning Considerations** : Factor in data residency, governance models, latency, integration complexity, cost, and AI readiness for enterprise-wide deployments.

Helps architects design provisioning strategies that ensure simplicity, enterprise consistency, compliance, and scalability for Customer 360, AI, and cross-platform innovation.

[Data 360 Interoperability](./Data%20360%20Decision%20Guides/Data%20360%20Interoperability.md) provides a framework for integrating Data 360 with external platforms and data lakes:

*   **Data Ingestion Patterns** : Real-time, streaming, and batch ingestion for creating governed canonical datasets ideal for Customer 360, compliance, and centralized governance.
*   **Zero-Copy Data Federation** : Live query, accelerated query (caching), and file federation methods to access external systems in real time without duplication, enabling personalization, dashboards, and AI/ML workloads.
*   **Hybrid Approach** : Combine governed ingestion for core datasets with zero-copy federation for freshness and scalability, supporting omni-channel engagement, Agentforce-driven actions, and enterprise analytics.
*   **Decision Framework** : Evaluate trade-offs in latency, cost, scalability, governance, and complexity to select the right integration pattern per data source.
*   **Architect Playbooks** : Industry-specific guidance, design practices, and cost considerations for finance, healthcare, retail, and telecom scenarios.

Guides architects in balancing data freshness, governance, and pipeline efficiency to build scalable, interoperable, AI-ready data architectures that support both operational and analytical workloads.
